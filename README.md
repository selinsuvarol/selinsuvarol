<h2>üëã Hi, I'm Selin!</h2>
As a creative junior frontend developer with a background in visual arts and education in marketing, I'm passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly UIs. üé®üíª

<h3>üöÄ My Journey So Far </h3>
My journey into coding started when I took a UX UI class during my master's degree, which sparked my interest in this field. During my master's program, I honed my design skills using Figma and worked on several detailed projects.

I got accepted into a NY/USA-based low-acceptance rate, intensive bootcamp for 6 months and now, I have experience with React, NEXT.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Material UI and GitHub. üöÄ

<h3> ü§ù Collaboration and Teamwork </h3>
I have collaborated on multiple group projects, including an e-commerce site with reusable components and a responsive movie database created with Vanilla JS. In addition to my technical skills, I'm an experienced team player, having worked with over 100 people while at Apple. ü§ù

<h3>üìù Graduation Project/Thesis </h3>
I then wrote my graduation project/thesis on a comparative analysis of Tailwind and Bootstrap, and ever since, I've been hooked on creating beautiful and responsive designs using the latest technologies. üìù

<h3>üéß Hobbies and Interests</h3>
Outside of work, I'm a techno enthusiast and love to attend concerts and festivals. In my free time, I'm also an avid concert photographer, capturing the energy and excitement of live performances. üéßüì∏

<h3>ü§ù Let's Connect!</h3>
I believe my artistic background and passion for technology make me a unique and valuable addition to any team. Let's connect and see how we can create something unique together. ü§ù
